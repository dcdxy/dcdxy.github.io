Changes in RNA splicing over the course of evolution have profoundly diversified the functional landscape of the human genome. While DNA sequences proximal to intron-exon junctions are known to be critical for RNA splicing, less is known about the impact of distal intronic sequences. We performed the first systematic assessment of the contribution of a specific type of mobile element pairs (called "Alus") in mediating loop-out exon skipping across the human genome. We further characterized the impact of these pairs on hominoid evolution.
