    Jelly and Fishie, the two sweetest floofs in the world. Jelly is the beautiful black and red tortoiseshell kitty, and Fishie is the handsome grey tabby kitty. They were adopted separately, first Jelly on a furniture shopping excursion (no, we didn't buy any furniture, just her). We later adopted Fishie as a companion for Jelly.
