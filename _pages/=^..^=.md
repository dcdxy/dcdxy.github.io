    Jelly and Fishie, the two sweetest floofs in the world. Jelly is the beautiful black and red tortoiseshell kitty, and Fishie is the handsome grey tabby kitty. They were adopted separately, first Jelly on a furniture shopping excursion (no, we didn't buy any furniture, just her). We later adopted Fishie as a companion for Jelly.

    Fishie was born into a managed feral colony in Toronto and was trapped at 3 months old. He was socialized in a foster home for 4 months and then became the best brother to Jelly!

    Jelly was named "Jellicle" at the shelter. I'm a huge fan of Cats the musical (no, not the movie!!) so it felt a bit like fate. Jelly has coined the term "independent floof", but while she can be very aloof, she can also bless you with the sweetest affection.
