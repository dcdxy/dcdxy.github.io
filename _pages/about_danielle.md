Hi! I'm Danielle. I grew up in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. I moved to Toronto in 2013 to pursue my studies at the University of Toronto.
I completed my bachelor's degree in physics and physiology, and my master's degree in computational biology.
I really enjoy studying basic biology mechanisms by using computational and statistical methods. I also love analyzing and visualizing data 
using the latest plotting libraries. I'm looking for opportunities to branch more into ML and Deep Learning projects. I'm currently pursuing a PhD in 
bioinformatics at Harvard University. Please visit my CV, projects, and publications pages for more details.
