Hi! I'm Danielle. I grew up in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. I moved to Toronto in 2013 to pursue my studies at the University of Toronto.
I completed my bachelor's degree in physics and physiology, and my master's degree in computational biology.
I'm currently based in Boston pursing a PhD in bioinformatics at Harvard University.

I really enjoy studying basic biology mechanisms by using computational and statistical methods. I also love analyzing and visualizing data using the latest plotting libraries. 
I'm looking for opportunities to branch more into ML and Deep Learning.
Please visit my CV, projects, and publications pages for more details.
