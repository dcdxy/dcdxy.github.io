I'm a PhD candidate in the Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics program at Harvard. Previously, I completed my undergraduate and Master's studies at the University of Toronto in Canada. My research interests include machine learning and deep learning applied to transposable elements, alternative splicing, 3D chromatin architecture, and epigenomics.
