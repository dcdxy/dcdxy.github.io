I'm a PhD candidate in the Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics program at Harvard. Previously, I completed my undergraduate and Master's studies at the University of Toronto in Canada. My research interests include transposable elements, alternative splicing, 3D chromatin architecture, and epigenomics.
