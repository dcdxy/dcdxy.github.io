  abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) is widely used to find transcription factor binding sites, but suffers from vari\
ous sources of noise. Knocking out the target factor mitigates noise by acting as a negative control. Paired wild-type and knockout experiments can gene\
rate improved motifs but require optimal differential analysis. We introduce peaKO{\textemdash}a method to automatically optimize motif analyses with kn\
ockout controls, which we compare to two other methods. PeaKO often improves elucidation of the target factor and highlights the benefits of knockout co\
ntrols, which far outperform input controls. It is freely available at https://peako.hoffmanlab.org.},
